# Welcome to the Free Preview of the Data Structures Course!

Welcome to the free preview of my Data Structures Course. In this preview, you will explore three out of the seven most common data structures used by programmers in the industry. They are:

- [Queues](1-queues.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module includes relevant code examples to facilitate your understanding of these data structures, followed by a challenging problem inspired by leading FAANG organizations (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) to test your knowledge. The programming language used throughout the course is Python.
